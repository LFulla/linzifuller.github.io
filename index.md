<h1>My Story</h1>
<p>
  Technology has always fascinated me—whether it’s the hardware that powers computers or the complex systems that make them function seamlessly. My passion for software development was sparked at a young age through games like Minecraft and League of Legends, where I became deeply interested in how software is built, optimized, and brought to life. In high school, this curiosity led me to compete in numerous coding competitions, ultimately securing an internship at Lockheed Martin in 2018 as a junior. That experience solidified my enthusiasm for engineering and my desire to lead teams in developing innovative solutions for the future.

I studied Computer Science and Mandarin Chinese at the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in Neural Networks, Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Automated Systems. However, due to the impact of COVID-19, I was unable to complete my bachelor's degree. Despite this, I remained committed to my career, spending four years at Lockheed Martin as a Software Engineer, where I worked on AR and VR development for gaming applications and later transitioned into Technical Project Management, overseeing the success of college internship teams.

Eager to formalize my project management expertise, I completed an 18-week Technical Project Management boot camp at Denver University, equipping me with the skills needed to earn Scrum Master Professional and Project Management Professional (PMP) certifications. This program strengthened my ability to lead Agile teams, manage project lifecycles, and drive cross-functional collaboration effectively.

Seeking to expand my leadership in project management, I joined S&P Global as a Scrum Master, where I oversaw three software development teams working on high-stakes contracts for clients such as Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, BMO, and RBC Wealth. This role allowed me to refine my Agile expertise, optimize development workflows, and drive collaboration across cross-functional teams.

Following my time at S&P Global, I transitioned to Returned.com, a fast-paced startup, where I took on the role of Engineering Manager. In this position, I wore many hats, working closely with the CEO, CPO, and CTO to shape product strategy, lead engineering efforts, and ensure seamless execution across technical and business initiatives.

With experience spanning enterprise-scale organizations to high-growth startups, I have honed my ability to solve complex problems, lead teams effectively, and drive project success. While my past roles have provided invaluable experience, I am now ready to embark on a new journey and take on fresh challenges in Technical Project Management. My experience leading government contracts, overseeing high-profile financial technology projects, and managing engineering teams in a startup environment has prepared me to thrive in a leadership role. I am excited to apply my technical expertise, leadership skills, and project management experience to drive innovation and deliver impactful results in my next role.
