							<h2>Technology has always fascinated me<br />
							whether it’s the hardware that powers computers or the complex systems that make them function seamlessly.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>My passion for software development began with games like Minecraft and League of Legends, sparking my curiosity about how software is built and optimized. In high school, I competed in coding competitions, leading to a Lockheed Martin internship in 2018, where I discovered my enthusiasm for engineering and leadership. </p>
						<p>I studied Computer Science and Mandarin at the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in AI, ML, AR, VR, and automation. Though COVID-19 disrupted my degree completion, I remained committed to my career, spending four years at Lockheed Martin as a Software Engineer, working on AR/VR applications before transitioning into Technical Project Management, where I led college internship teams.</p>
						<p>To formalize my expertise, I completed an 18-week Technical Project Management boot camp at Denver University, gaining skills in Agile leadership, project lifecycles, and cross-functional collaboration. I then joined S&P Global as a Scrum Master, overseeing three software development teams on high-profile financial contracts. Later, at Returned.com, I became an Engineering Manager, working with executives to drive product strategy and execution in a fast-paced startup.</p>
						<p>With experience in enterprise and startup environments, I excel at solving complex problems, leading teams, and driving project success. Now, I’m eager to apply my technical expertise and leadership skills in a new Technical Project Management role to deliver innovation and impactful results.</p>
